    <h1>Hello from Branch B</h1>
    <h1> Branching, Merging & Conflict Resolution </h1>

    <h1>Hello from header-conflict branch</h1>

    <p> This is a sample document to demonstrate branching, merging, and conflict resolution in version control systems like Git. </p>
    <h2> Branching </h2>
    <p> Branching allows you to create a separate line of development in your project. This is useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. </p>
    <h2> Merging </h2>
    <p> Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when a feature or bug fix is complete and ready to be added to the main codebase. </p>
    <h2> Conflict Resolution </h2>
    <p> Conflicts can occur during merging when changes in different branches affect the same lines of code. Resolving these conflicts involves manually reviewing the changes and deciding which version to keep. </p>
